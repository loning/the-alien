## 29.1 The Inheritance That Spans Time Itself

Collapse-timeline inheritance practices represent systems where beings inherit not just material goods but temporal access and timeline privileges—inheritance that includes the right to exist in specific time periods or access particular temporal regions. Through $\psi = \psi(\psi)$, we explore how alien civilizations develop inheritance systems that pass down temporal rights and temporal property across generations.

$$
\text{Inheritance} = \{\text{temporal access rights}, \text{timeline property}\}
$$

where temporal rights are inherited across generations.
