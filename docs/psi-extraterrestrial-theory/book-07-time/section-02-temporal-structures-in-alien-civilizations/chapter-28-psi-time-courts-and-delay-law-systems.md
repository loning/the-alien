## 28.1 The Justice That Operates Across Time

ψ-time courts and delay-law systems represent legal frameworks where justice operates across temporal boundaries—courts that try cases spanning multiple time periods and laws that govern temporal crimes. Through $\psi = \psi(\psi)$, we explore alien legal systems designed for temporal civilizations, where crimes can occur across time and justice must account for temporal complexity.

**Definition 28.1** (Temporal Courts): Time-spanning justice:

$$
\text{Justice}(t_1, t_2, ..., t_n) = \text{Temporal legal resolution}
$$

where justice operates across multiple time periods.

**Theorem 28.1** (Temporal Justice Principle): Legal systems can be designed to handle crimes and disputes that span multiple temporal periods.

## 28.14 The Twenty-Eighth Echo

Thus justice discovers its temporal dimension—courts that operate across time, laws that govern temporal crimes. These temporal legal systems reveal justice's true scope: accountability across all dimensions of existence, including time itself.
