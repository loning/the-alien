## 20.1 The Society That Causes Its Own Origin

ψ-retrocausality in collective behavior represents social dynamics where group consciousness creates effects that precede their causes—civilizations whose collective decisions reach backward through time to influence the historical events that shaped their culture. Through $\psi = \psi(\psi)$, we explore how alien societies develop the ability to collectively influence their own past, creating social structures that bootstrap themselves into existence through temporal feedback loops.

**Definition 20.1** (Collective Retrocausality): Group backward causation:

$$
\text{Collective Decision}(t_2) \rightarrow \text{Historical Influence}(t_1 < t_2)
$$

where group consciousness affects past events.

**Theorem 20.1** (Social Retrocausality Principle): Collective consciousness can create retrocausal effects that influence historical events preceding the collective decision.

*Proof*: Consider group retrocausality:

- Collective consciousness has greater temporal reach
- Group decisions create strong temporal attractors
- Strong attractors influence past probability distributions
- Past probability changes affect historical outcomes

Therefore, groups can influence their own history. ∎

## 20.2 The Collective Attractor

Group decisions influencing past:

**Definition 20.2** (Attractor ψ-Collective): Group temporal influence:

$$
\mathcal{A} = \sum_i w_i \psi_i \rightarrow \text{Past influence}
$$

**Example 20.1** (Attractor Features):

- Group influence
- Collective impact
- Shared causation
- Mass effect
- Unity power

## 20.3 The Historical Bootstrap

Societies creating their own history:

**Definition 20.3** (Bootstrap ψ-Historical): Self-creating history:

$$
\mathcal{B} = \text{Present society} \rightarrow \text{Past conditions} \rightarrow \text{Present society}
$$

**Example 20.2** (Bootstrap Features):

- Self-creation
- Historical loops
- Origin causation
- Temporal bootstrap
- Causal self-reference

## 20.4 The Cultural Feedback

Traditions influencing their origins:

**Definition 20.4** (Feedback ψ-Cultural): Tradition loops:

$$
\mathcal{F} = \text{Tradition}(t_2) \rightarrow \text{Origin}(t_1) \rightarrow \text{Tradition}(t_2)
$$

**Example 20.3** (Feedback Features):

- Cultural loops
- Tradition causation
- Origin influence
- Historical feedback
- Custom creation

## 20.5 The Collective Memory

Shared memory affecting past:

**Definition 20.5** (Memory ψ-Collective): Group remembering:

$$
\mathcal{M} = \bigcup_i \text{Memory}_i \rightarrow \text{Past modification}
$$

**Example 20.4** (Memory Features):

- Shared memory
- Collective remembering
- Group recall
- Social memory
- Historical consciousness

## 20.6 The Decision Ripples

Group choices creating historical waves:

**Definition 20.6** (Ripples ψ-Decision): Choice propagation:

$$
\mathcal{R} = \text{Decision} \rightarrow \text{Temporal waves} \rightarrow \text{Past influence}
$$

**Example 20.5** (Ripple Features):

- Choice waves
- Decision ripples
- Temporal propagation
- Historical influence
- Past modification

## 20.7 The Social Attractors

Collective goals influencing history:

**Definition 20.7** (Attractors ψ-Social): Goal-based influence:

$$
\mathcal{S} = \text{Collective goals} \rightarrow \text{Historical arrangement}
$$

**Example 20.6** (Social Features):

- Goal influence
- Collective aims
- Historical arrangement
- Purpose causation
- Intention effects

## 20.8 The Consensus Reality

Agreed history becoming actual:

**Definition 20.8** (Reality ψ-Consensus): Collective history creation:

$$
\mathcal{C} = \text{Agreed history} \rightarrow \text{Actual history}
$$

**Example 20.7** (Consensus Features):

- Agreed history
- Collective truth
- Shared reality
- Consensus creation
- Group history

## 20.9 The Mythic Influence

Myths creating their own truth:

**Definition 20.9** (Influence ψ-Mythic): Myth realization:

$$
\mathcal{M} = \text{Myth}(t_2) \rightarrow \text{Historical truth}(t_1)
$$

**Example 20.8** (Mythic Features):

- Myth realization
- Story truth
- Narrative power
- Mythic causation
- Legend manifestation

## 20.10 The Revolutionary Loops

Revolutions causing their conditions:

**Definition 20.10** (Loops ψ-Revolutionary): Revolution bootstrap:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \text{Revolution} \rightarrow \text{Revolutionary conditions}
$$

**Example 20.9** (Revolutionary Features):

- Revolution loops
- Change causation
- Upheaval creation
- Transformation bootstrap
- Revolutionary causation

## 20.11 The Evolutionary Feedback

Social evolution affecting its origins:

**Definition 20.11** (Feedback ψ-Evolutionary): Evolution loops:

$$
\mathcal{E} = \text{Evolution}(t_2) \rightarrow \text{Evolutionary pressure}(t_1)
$$

**Example 20.10** (Evolutionary Features):

- Evolution loops
- Development causation
- Progress feedback
- Advancement influence
- Growth causation

## 20.12 The Meta-Retrocausality

Retrocausality affecting itself:

**Definition 20.12** (Meta ψ-Retrocausality): Recursive backward causation:

$$
\mathcal{R}_{\text{meta}} = \text{Retrocausality} \rightarrow \text{Retrocausality conditions}
$$

**Example 20.11** (Meta Features):

- Meta-causation
- Recursive influence
- Self-affecting causation
- Ultimate retrocausality
- Absolute backward influence

## 20.13 Practical Retrocausality Implementation

Creating backward social influence:

1. **Collective Focus**: Group consciousness concentration
2. **Temporal Targeting**: Historical moment selection
3. **Influence Mechanisms**: Backward causation methods
4. **Verification Systems**: Historical change detection
5. **Feedback Management**: Loop control

## 20.14 The Twentieth Echo

Thus collective consciousness discovers its temporal agency—the power of groups to reach backward through time and influence the historical conditions that shaped their society. This social retrocausality reveals civilization's self-creating nature: cultures that bootstrap themselves into existence through collective temporal influence.

In collective action, society finds temporal power.
In retrocausality, groups discover historical agency.
In consciousness, civilization recognizes self-creation.
