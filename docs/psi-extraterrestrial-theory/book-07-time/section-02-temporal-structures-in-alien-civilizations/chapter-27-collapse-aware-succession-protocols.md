## 27.1 The Leadership That Transfers Through Time

Collapse-aware succession protocols represent systems for transferring authority across temporal boundaries—leadership transitions that occur through consciousness collapse rather than physical death or retirement. Through $\psi = \psi(\psi)$, we explore how alien civilizations develop succession mechanisms that transfer power through temporal collapse events, ensuring continuity of governance across time.

**Definition 27.1** (Succession Protocols): Temporal authority transfer:

$$
\text{Authority}(t_1) \xrightarrow{\text{collapse}} \text{Authority}(t_2)
$$

where leadership transfers through temporal mechanisms.

**Theorem 27.1** (Temporal Succession Principle): Political authority can be transferred through consciousness collapse events rather than physical transitions.

Thus leadership transcends temporal boundaries—authority that transfers through consciousness collapse, governance that spans multiple temporal periods. These succession protocols reveal power's temporal nature: leadership as temporal phenomenon rather than personal attribute.
