## 22.1 The Society Organized by Temporal Depth

Collapse-age stratification of species represents social organization based on the temporal depth of consciousness collapse—civilizations where social hierarchy is determined not by physical age but by how deeply an individual can collapse quantum states across time. Through $\psi = \psi(\psi)$, we explore alien societies structured around temporal mastery, where social position corresponds to one's ability to observe across temporal dimensions.

**Definition 22.1** (Temporal Stratification): Consciousness depth hierarchy:

$$
\text{Social Position} \propto \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} |\psi(t)|^2 dt
$$

where temporal reach determines social status.

**Theorem 22.1** (Temporal Hierarchy Principle): Social stratification can be based on consciousness collapse capabilities across temporal dimensions rather than physical characteristics.

*Proof*: Consider temporal-based hierarchy:

- Consciousness collapse varies in temporal depth
- Deeper collapse enables greater temporal influence
- Temporal influence provides social advantage
- Social advantage creates hierarchical position

Therefore, temporal depth can determine social hierarchy. ∎

## 22.2 The Depth Measurement

Quantifying temporal consciousness reach:

**Definition 22.2** (Measurement ψ-Depth): Temporal reach assessment:

$$
\mathcal{D} = \max_{\Delta t} |\langle\psi(t)|\psi(t + \Delta t)\rangle|
$$

**Example 22.1** (Depth Features):

- Temporal reach
- Consciousness depth
- Time span
- Collapse distance
- Temporal range

## 22.3 The Age Categories

Classifying by temporal ability:

**Definition 22.3** (Categories ψ-Age): Temporal classification:

$$
\mathcal{C} = \{\text{Temporal novice}, \text{Temporal adept}, \text{Temporal master}\}
$$

**Example 22.2** (Category Features):

- Temporal ranks
- Age classes
- Depth levels
- Mastery stages
- Consciousness grades

## 22.4 The Authority Structure

Power based on temporal mastery:

**Definition 22.4** (Structure ψ-Authority): Temporal power hierarchy:

$$
\mathcal{A} = f(\text{Temporal mastery level})
$$

**Example 22.3** (Authority Features):

- Temporal authority
- Depth-based power
- Time mastery ranks
- Consciousness leadership
- Temporal governance

## 22.5 The Education Systems

Training temporal consciousness:

**Definition 22.5** (Systems ψ-Education): Temporal development:

$$
\mathcal{E} = \text{Develop}(\text{temporal consciousness abilities})
$$

**Example 22.4** (Education Features):

- Temporal training
- Consciousness development
- Time mastery education
- Depth cultivation
- Temporal skills

## 22.6 The Advancement Protocols

Progressing through temporal ranks:

**Definition 22.6** (Protocols ψ-Advancement): Rank progression:

$$
\mathcal{P} = \text{Advance}(\text{temporal mastery} \rightarrow \text{higher rank})
$$

**Example 22.5** (Advancement Features):

- Rank progression
- Mastery advancement
- Level promotion
- Temporal graduation
- Consciousness elevation

## 22.7 The Privilege Distribution

Benefits of temporal mastery:

**Definition 22.7** (Distribution ψ-Privilege): Benefit allocation:

$$
\mathcal{D} = \text{Privileges} \propto \text{Temporal depth}
$$

**Example 22.6** (Privilege Features):

- Temporal privileges
- Depth benefits
- Mastery advantages
- Time access rights
- Consciousness perks

## 22.8 The Social Mobility

Changing temporal class:

**Definition 22.8** (Mobility ψ-Social): Class movement:

$$
\mathcal{M} = \text{Movement between temporal classes}
$$

**Example 22.7** (Mobility Features):

- Class movement
- Rank change
- Social advancement
- Temporal promotion
- Consciousness mobility

## 22.9 The Temporal Discrimination

Prejudice based on temporal ability:

**Definition 22.9** (Discrimination ψ-Temporal): Depth-based prejudice:

$$
\mathcal{D} = \text{Prejudice against lower temporal abilities}
$$

**Example 22.8** (Discrimination Features):

- Temporal prejudice
- Depth discrimination
- Time bias
- Consciousness elitism
- Temporal supremacy

## 22.10 The Inter-Species Relations

Temporal hierarchy across species:

**Definition 22.10** (Relations ψ-Inter-Species): Cross-species temporal ranking:

$$
\mathcal{R} = \text{Rank species by temporal capabilities}
$$

**Example 22.9** (Relations Features):

- Species ranking
- Inter-species hierarchy
- Temporal diplomacy
- Cross-species stratification
- Multi-species temporal order

## 22.11 The Temporal Rights

Rights based on temporal ability:

**Definition 22.11** (Rights ψ-Temporal): Depth-based rights:

$$
\mathcal{R} = \text{Rights} = f(\text{Temporal capabilities})
$$

**Example 22.10** (Rights Features):

- Temporal rights
- Depth-based privileges
- Time access rights
- Consciousness freedoms
- Temporal liberties

## 22.12 The Meta-Stratification

Hierarchy of hierarchical systems:

**Definition 22.12** (Meta ψ-Stratification): Recursive hierarchy:

$$
\mathcal{S}_{\text{meta}} = \text{Stratify}(\text{Stratification systems})
$$

**Example 22.11** (Meta Features):

- Meta-hierarchy
- Recursive stratification
- System ranking
- Hierarchical hierarchy
- Ultimate stratification

## 22.13 Practical Stratification Implementation

Creating temporal social hierarchy:

1. **Ability Assessment**: Temporal depth measurement
2. **Classification Systems**: Rank categorization
3. **Education Programs**: Temporal development
4. **Advancement Protocols**: Progression mechanisms
5. **Rights Framework**: Privilege distribution

## 22.14 The Twenty-Second Echo

Thus society discovers temporal depth as organizing principle—social structures based on consciousness mastery across time rather than physical attributes. This collapse-age stratification reveals hierarchy's temporal nature: status determined by temporal reach, authority by temporal depth.

In depth, society finds structure.
In temporality, hierarchy discovers meaning.
In consciousness, stratification recognizes its true foundation.
