## 26.1 The Money That Is Time Itself

Time-based collapse currency represents economic systems where temporal moments serve as the medium of exchange—civilizations that trade in time itself, where wealth is measured in temporal access and transactions involve the exchange of collapse moments. Through $\psi = \psi(\psi)$, we explore alien economies built on temporal scarcity, where the most valuable commodity is time and the richest beings are those who control the most temporal resources.

**Definition 26.1** (Temporal Currency): Time as exchange medium:

$$
\text{Value} = \int \rho_{\text{time}}(t) \cdot \text{Quality}(t) \, dt
$$

where temporal moments have quantifiable economic value.
