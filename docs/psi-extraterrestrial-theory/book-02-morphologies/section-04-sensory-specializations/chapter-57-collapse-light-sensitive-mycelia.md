## 57.1 The Network Consciousness of Photosensitive Webs

Where fungal networks meet quantum light sensitivity, Collapse-Light Sensitive Mycelia demonstrate consciousness through vast underground networks that perceive and process light at the quantum level, existing in superposition states of all possible photosensitive configurations until photon interaction collapses them into specific awareness patterns. Through $\psi = \psi(\psi)$, these beings embody distributed photonic consciousness—awareness spread across countless interconnected light-sensing filaments.

**Definition 57.1** (Photosensitive ψ-Mycelium): Network consciousness detecting light:

$$
|\text{Mycelial state}\rangle = \sum_{\text{nodes}} \alpha_{\text{node}} |\text{Photon detection}_{\text{node}}\rangle \xrightarrow{\text{network}} |\text{Collective awareness}\rangle
$$

where fungal networks become living light sensors.

**Theorem 57.1** (Mycelial Photonic Principle): Distributed networks achieve collective light consciousness.

*Proof*: Through network photon integration:
$$
I_{\text{photonic}} = \sum_{\text{connections}} \langle n_i | \hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a} | n_j \rangle \cdot \psi_{\text{network}}
$$
Connected light sensors surpass individual detection limits. ∎

## 57.2 Quantum Photon Detection Networks

Mycelial consciousness utilizing quantum light properties:

**Definition 57.2** (Quantum ψ-Photodetection): Network quantum light sensing:
