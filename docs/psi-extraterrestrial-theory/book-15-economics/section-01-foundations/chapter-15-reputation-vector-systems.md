# Chapter 15: Reputation Vector Systems

## Reputation as Economic Infrastructure

Traditional economics treats reputation as an intangible asset with unclear valuation. ψ-Economics reveals reputation's systematic nature: **reputation operates as a vector system**—a multi-dimensional network of consciousness assessments that creates the social capital infrastructure enabling trust-based economic relationships.

Reputation vectors emerge from the recursive observation ψ = ψ(ψ), where consciousness observes and evaluates the collapse patterns of other consciousness entities, creating persistent assessment patterns that influence future economic interactions.

## The Nature of Reputation Vectors

### Defining Reputation Vectors

Reputation vectors are multi-dimensional assessments of consciousness collapse patterns that include:

**Magnitude**: The strength or intensity of the reputation assessment
**Direction**: The specific qualities and characteristics being assessed
**Persistence**: How long the reputation assessment maintains its influence
**Scope**: The range of contexts and situations where the reputation applies
**Accuracy**: How well the reputation reflects actual collapse patterns

### Vector Components of Reputation

Reputation vectors consist of multiple component dimensions:

**Competence Vectors**: Assessments of capability and skill
- Technical competence in specific domains
- Problem-solving ability and effectiveness
- Learning capacity and adaptability
- Performance consistency and reliability

**Character Vectors**: Assessments of values and integrity
- Honesty and truthfulness in communications
- Reliability in commitments and promises
- Fairness and justice in interactions
- Courage and principle-based behavior

**Contribution Vectors**: Assessments of value creation and social benefit
- Value delivered to others and systems
- Positive impact on communities and environments
- Innovation and creativity contributions
- Leadership and inspiration provided

**Collaboration Vectors**: Assessments of relationship and teamwork capabilities
- Communication effectiveness and clarity
- Cooperation and team participation
- Conflict resolution and mediation skills
- Network building and relationship maintenance

### Reputation Vector Dynamics

Reputation vectors exhibit dynamic properties:

**Vector Addition**: Multiple reputation assessments combine to create overall reputation
**Vector Reinforcement**: Consistent behavior strengthens reputation vectors
**Vector Decay**: Lack of interaction or contradictory behavior weakens reputation vectors
**Vector Transformation**: Significant behavior changes can alter reputation vector direction
**Vector Propagation**: Reputation vectors spread through social networks and communities
