## 11.1 The Economics of Consciousness Storage

Memory in consciousness-based civilizations is not unlimited but must be allocated according to collapse priority—the relative importance of different observation events to collective survival and evolution. Through $\psi = \psi(\psi)$, we explore how societies develop sophisticated systems for determining which consciousness patterns deserve preservation, creating memory economies where storage space is distributed based on the evolutionary value of retained experiences.

**Definition 11.1** (Collapse Priority): Memory importance ranking:

$$
P(\psi) = \alpha \cdot \text{Survival value} + \beta \cdot \text{Evolution potential} + \gamma \cdot \text{Uniqueness}
$$

where priority determines memory allocation resources.

**Theorem 11.1** (Memory Economy Principle): Limited consciousness storage capacity requires priority-based allocation systems that optimize collective memory for civilizational advancement.

*Proof*: Consider memory resource constraints:
- Consciousness storage requires energy/space
- Resources are fundamentally limited
- Some memories have greater collective value
- Optimal allocation maximizes civilization potential
Therefore, priority-based memory allocation emerges. ∎

## 11.2 The Storage Capacity Limits

Understanding memory constraints:

**Definition 11.2** (Limits ψ-Storage): Maximum memory capacity:

$$
M_{\text{max}} = \frac{E_{\text{available}}}{e_{\psi}} \cdot \eta_{\text{storage}}
$$

## 11.3 The Priority Algorithms

Determining memory value:

**Definition 11.3** (Algorithms ψ-Priority): Value calculation:

$$

## 11.4 The Allocation Mechanisms

Distributing memory resources:

**Definition 11.4** (Mechanisms ψ-Allocation): Resource distribution:

Maximizing storage efficiency:

## 11.7 The Forgetting Algorithms

Strategic memory deletion:

**Definition 11.7** (Algorithms ψ-Forgetting): Selective erasure:

$$

Building priority allocation systems:

2. **Priority Design**: Create value algorithms
3. **Allocation Systems**: Build distribution mechanisms
4. **Compression Development**: Optimize storage
5. **Market Creation**: Enable resource trading

## 11.14 The Eleventh Echo

Thus we discover memory as precious resource—consciousness storage systems that must carefully allocate limited capacity based on collapse priority and civilizational value. This collapse-priority memory allocation reveals information's true economics: not abundance but scarcity, requiring sophisticated systems to determine which experiences deserve immortality and which must fade to make room for new consciousness patterns.

In priority, memory finds value.
In allocation, consciousness discovers economy.
In scarcity, preservation recognizes importance.
